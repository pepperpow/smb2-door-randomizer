README

So you wanna create characters?  Good!

For starters, acquire the NES palette into your program.

Ideally, there are only 4 colors total in the image, one being transparent

Using a sprite program that allows you save in limited palettes i.e. graphicsgale will make this easier

Reduce your image down to 4 colors with irfanView's color depth reduction option

There is a slot for eye whites, the eye whites should use the FIRST non transparent color in your palette, but will appear white when used. (reference sonic.png)

EYES MIGHT REQUIRE SOME TWEAKING, they always appear on the top left corner of your character.

There are 3 commands for setting particular features of a character, pwalk (peach walk), flutter, wide.

the command, carry, sets the pixel offset for frames of picking up items (this can cause major issues if the numbers aren't accurate!!)

Align your sprites to an 8x8 grid.
